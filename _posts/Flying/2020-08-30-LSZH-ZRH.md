## ENROUTE


## ARRIVAL
- FE : 1417ft !!!
- After L/D via RWY 14, no enough time and contact apron directly. Be carefull D taxiway is very close from vacated taxiway.
- In case of RWY 14, there is no special STAR, only Transition chart.



## DEPARTURE
- ATC clearance 15min before departure. And request longer RWY. If fully ready for push, have to contact delivery first.
- ATIS said DEP RWY28, but too short for us.. So usually RWY 16 or 34 (dispatch inform to us about T/O RWY)


## STAY
- Near hotel there are 2 store, ALDI(cross the road), COOL
- 동신항운(http://www.jungfrau.co.kr) : 융프라우패스
- 뮈렌 피르스트 카트
