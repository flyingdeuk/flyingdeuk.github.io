## English Version

### ENROUTE
	-  if eastern wind expected, it have to expect gate hold procedure. It means delay on the ground several hours. So it needed extra fuel. Because east wind make using RWY 10L/R for departure and RWY 19L for landing. It means all departing airplane (domestic, international) using 10L/R. normally 01L/R for domestic light weight airplane and 28L/R for international heavy weight airplane. That is why being gate hold procedure at this airport, I thought.
	- So eastern wind forecast, it means extra fuel.  
	- In case of eastern wind, L/D RWY 19L, STLER 3 RNAV ARR is used.

### ARRIVAL
	- descend via ARR
	- RWY 28L/R simultaneous app is too close from another traffic. so be careful and keep insight.
	- this airport is especially simultaneous takeoff RWY01L/R and simultaneous landing RWY 28L/R. maybe the reason is both RWY angle is cross shape…
	- They use inner spot 1 &3 for inbound, 2 &4 for outbound




### DEPARTURE
	- CPDLC ATC said next freq 121.8 (GND) but have to request push back to ramp tower.
	- RWY 28L takeoff

### STAY
	- regency lounge is good. 9 floor and smoking area
	- Can not buy beer after 12 AM.
	- downtown : coffee (4 barrels), blue bottle
