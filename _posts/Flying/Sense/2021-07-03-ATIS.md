ATIS(Automatic terminal information service)

`Wiki's`
>Automatic terminal information service, or ATIS, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit, which reduces the controllers' workload and relieves frequency congestion

### FAA
#### CASE 1

**5 x x x x**

해당 내용 5로 시작되는 5자리 숫자는 기압변화 경향을 나타낸다.  

> h. 3-Hourly Pressure Tendency (5appp). At designated stations, the 3-hourly pressure tendency group shall be coded in the format, 5appp, where 5 is the group indicator, a is the character of pressure change over the past 3 hours (see Table 12-7), and ppp is the amount of barometric change in tenths of hectopascals (see Table 12-8). The amount of barometric change shall be coded using the tens, units, and tenths digits (see paragraphs 11.4.7 and 11.5.4). For example, a steady increase of 3.2 hectopascals in the past three hours would be coded "52032"

그외에도 숫자로 시작되는 코드등은 아래와 같다.

**1 x x x x**

> e. 6-Hourly Maximum Temperature (1sn Tx Tx Tx ). At designated stations, the 6-hourly maximum temperature group shall be coded in the format, 1sn Tx Tx Tx , where 1 is the group indicator, s n is the sign of the temperature, Tx Tx T x is the maximum temperature in tenths of degrees Celsius using three digits (see paragraphs 10.4.4, 10.5.2, and 10.5.3). The sign of the maximum temperature shall be coded as 1 if the maximum temperature is below 0°C and 0 if the maximum temperature is 0°C or higher. For example, a maximum temperature of n2.1°C would be coded "11021"; 14.2°C would be coded "10142".

**2 x x x x**
>f. 6-Hourly Minimum Temperature (2sn Tn Tn Tn ). At designated stations, the 6-hourly minimum temperature group shall be coded in the format, 2sn Tn Tn Tn , where 2 is the group indicator, s n is the sign of the temperature, and Tn Tn T n is the minimum temperature in tenths of degrees Celsius using three digits (see paragraphs 10.4.4, 10.5.2, and 10.5.3). The sign of the minimum temperature shall be coded as 1 if the minimum temperature is below 0°C and 0 if the minimum temperature is 0°C or higher. For example, a minimum temperature of n0.1°C would be coded "21001"; 1.2°C would be coded "20012".

**4 x x x x x x x x**
>g. 24-Hour Maximum and Minimum Temperature (4sn Tx Tx Tx sn Tn Tn Tn ). At designated stations, the 24-hour maximum temperature and the 24-hour minimum temperature shall be coded in the format, 4sn Tx Tx Tx sn Tn Tn Tn , where 4 is the group indicator, s n is the sign of the temperature, Tx Tx Tx  is the maximum 24-hour temperature, and Tn Tn T n is the 24-hour minimum temperature (see paragraphs 10.4.4, 10.5.2, and 10.5.3). Tx Tx T x and Tn Tn T n shall be coded in tenths of degrees Celsius using three digits. The sign of the maximum or minimum temperature shall be coded as 1 if it is below 0°C and 0 if it is 0°C or higher. For example, a 24-hour maximum temperature of 10.0°C and a 24-hour minimum temperature of n1.5°C would be coded "401001015"; a 24-hour maximum temperature of 11.2°C and a 24-hour minimum temperature of 8.4°C would be coded as "401120084".
