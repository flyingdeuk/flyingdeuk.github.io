## ENROUTE
- EDYY mastrich CPDLC log on was asked. and working well recently.


## ARRIVAL
- RWY 27 : DCT ARTIP then PAM but PAM waypoint is not on approach chart. (PAM, SPL, SPY)
- They controlled by VOR fix PAM, SPL, SPY. Usually but PAM, SPY only charted in SID chart. So always put those in fix page.
- After vacate RWY then immediately contact GND automatically. Refer 10-9 chart.
- TAXI direction can be found in chart by arrow. TWY A/B (clockwise or counter...) especially after L/D 18C they don’t give us twy A or B… so always see the jeppesen chart in details.


## DEPARTURE
- Cargo : RWY 24 S8 intersection T/O, PAX : RWY 24 S6 intersection T/O
- PDC ACARS available but monitor delivery freq and then clearance confirmed. Freq have to change to Planner Freq automatically.
- Planner give changing to GND freq at TSAT!!!
- Recheck SID SPD restrictions, FLAP UP SPD is high in case of NADP2. so maintain FLAP 1.
- Same outbound directions SID has difference name by RWY designator. so watch carefully.
- There is CONTINUATION CHART, but unuseful.
- RWY 36L take off is too long taxi time. (using Z taxiway)
- CLR FOR T/O remain this freq.
