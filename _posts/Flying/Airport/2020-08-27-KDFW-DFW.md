  - over LATAK 129.4 estimate BISIV

## ARRIVAL
- During descend via DEBBE x, profile is deep so expecting use of speedbrakes.
- Shoud contact RAMP TWR before entering RAMP area by RADIO center.(GND don't handoff to RAMP TWR.)
- Via Spot 142 to Gate D11A

- There are different STAR from same Transition Point(MDANO) depending on Landing North or South
- STAR was changed several times. Bowie x arrival use north and south landing. JOVEM landing north only. VKTRY landing south only.
- Sometimes in the night flight (cargo flight) they give us DCT "DFW airport" (no dallas airport).
