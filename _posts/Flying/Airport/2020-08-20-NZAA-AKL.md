Enrouthe상의 CPDLC, HF 절차와 적도 부근 Wx Dev에 대한 고려가 필수인 공항임.


## Airport Map
![akl]({{"/img/flying/airport/akl_ap.jpg" | relative_url}})

## ENROUTE
- CUSTOM form from cabin crew.
- GUAM CERAP : combined Center/Radar Approach Control
- GUAM center don't have CPDLC. So try to contact KZAK, if disconnected.
- MORESBY radio have to contact via HF before 20min FIR. It is to hard to find in enroute chart. 8903 was contacted. (pacific ocean chart 2!!!)
- They instruct to contact MORESBY 123.4. no CPDLC. I think because of within RDR coverage.
- HONIARA area controlled by BRISBANE. They instruct monitoring HF freq by CPDLC but I think doing the SELCAL check is better way.
- ** PORT MORESBY ACC 00675-325-0931 (NOTAM number not connected) getting from ACARS of company. 

## ARRIVAL
- During arrival, they ask any direct point.
- Pronunciation is difficult to understand.
- There is a speed limit.
- Before entering ramp area, have to contact ramp controller. They hand off to ramp control.



## DEPARTURE
- Just before SPOT 2, change freq to GND.
- DEP freq automatically was changed. And then instruct turning after 3000ft.
- GND SELCAL CHK ?!?!
- There is not CAT IIIa approach.. So in low visibility condition, we have to check takeoff alternate airport. No fuel consideration only select airport and need to know NOTAM and WX information at takeoff alternate airport.
- We can use takeoff alternate within 1 hour as NZOH(military airport)

## STAY
- No limit of WIFI (wrong information)
- Big water bottle in the room
- No CREW LOUNGE
- No exchange service at hotel (only airport or artte)
- Nearest mart name is COUNTDOWN MART. And liquor store, small restaurants near hotel.
- Butter can also liquid restriction… It was taken away.
