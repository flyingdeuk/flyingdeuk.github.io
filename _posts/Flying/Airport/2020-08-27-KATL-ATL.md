일부 Blind Area가 존재하고 그에 따른 정확한 위치에서의 Radio Contact이 중요함.

## ENROUTE


## ARRIVAL
- ATC usually calls TWY D to "Dixie"
- After L/D when crossing RWY, we have to contact TWR and then
 before passing DIXIE, contact GND then
 6 north hold short then contact non movement ramp control, then
 before TWY L, contact metering or GND...
 (we have to contact proper ATC at exact positions)
- Pronunciation is different. and speaking speed too fast. so listen carefully.
- GND does not instruct to change freq to RAMP center. so should contact RAMP before entering ramp area by RADIO center.

- CARGO
>we can get RWY 28.<br>
