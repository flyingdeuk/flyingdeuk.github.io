>Traffic이 많은 공항. 이륙, 착륙 항공기 분리를 위해서 Quick Climb, Quick Descend를 요구함. <br>
동풍시 RWY 13L/R VOR 고려해야함. (FMS data로 많이 편해짐.)

## ARRIVAL
- CARGO : No ramp control. Stop middle of cargo ramp then go to stand by towing. (Don't do shutdown flow!!)

- There are many airport around JFK. So arrival descend, departure climb rapidly.
- ILS 22L over station then deep descent is required because need to separate from departing traffic.
- VOR 13L has two VASI L/T. watch out.
- Sometimes IGN(Kingstone) NW 40NM FL280... Means IGN/-40NM!!!
