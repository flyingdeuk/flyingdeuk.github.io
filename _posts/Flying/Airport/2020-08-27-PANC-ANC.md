## ENROUTE
- Using NOPAC RTE, it takes around 7~8 hours.
- Depart from PVG, have to check temp control and MTOW!!

#  ARRIVAL
- NEELL3 arrival only use for RWY07L/R. so in case of RWY33. still remain flight plan fix then modify after getting clearance because of there is no transition and arrival chart for RWY33.
- So sometimes ATC give "DCT AMOTT then PANC(it is different of TED)" during RWY 33 in use.
- In the midnight, for CARGO flight. They give us DCT IF(intermediate fix) and after landing only use TWR FREQ until parking.
- Parking spot R10… have to confirm chocks in. because spot is downslope.
- Not needed requesting start up clearance.  delivery said just "call for taxi"
- Instruction usually  give K file arrival instead of filed flight plan arrival.
- Recently immigration say no needed immigration form any more.
- ANC quarantine procedure. They threw away all food from ICN. Except beverage(coke, sprite, water…).




## DEPARTURE
- RWY33 : dep AFT T/O Right Turn H/D 190
- In case of RWY 7L departure SID say TED 4NM or 2000ft come first turn… but FMS is TED 4NM and 2000ft. So should consider after 2000ft HDG SEL. It is exactly procedure.
- After takeoff we can connect CPDLC to PAZA,
- Before crossing, have to check amber light. It is not stopbar light.  
- start up pilot discretion. Pushback is not needed.

## STAY

- Only liquor shop until 10pm
