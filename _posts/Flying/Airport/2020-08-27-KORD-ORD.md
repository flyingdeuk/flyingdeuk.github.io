RWY 10L,28R의 경우 이륙에 주로 사용되며 Intersection 이륙이 Default로 이용되고, 착륙항공기는 Full Length Intersection Point에서 RWY Cross시킴. (이륙항공기 뒤에서 활주로를 건너가는 형태임.)<br>
`ORD x DEP는 FMS상 RWY만 Select되고 10M'이상 속도 Limit 주의 필요.`


## Airport Map
![ord](/img/flying/airport/ord_ap.jpg)

## ENROUTE
- CZEG SQ IDENT? (strange pronunciation?)
- FSD - MCW - JVL - JANESVILLE x ARR (have to confirm clearance limit about transition point MCW)
- RERTE THEN FYTTE x arr
- ATC don't understand lima(L/H) side.
- When request Wx dev left side, they give us RERTE - ZZIPR - FYTTE x arr

- If unable to contact MAGADAN of KAMCHAT RTE back to ICN, we can use CPDLC by position report.
- Usually no RDR contact until ARLIM.
- Before Chicago center, contact milwaukee center, milwaukee center give us different altimeter setting.

## ARRIVAL
- Intercept MYRRS instead of direct MYRRS. Meaning is same.
- Company route include arrival fix. So they don't give us arrival clearance.
- Sometimes DCT ORD airport then RDR vector.
- Before RAMP IN, have to contact ramp tower(129.05) automatically, usually they don't handover ramp tower. And monitor both Freq monitor
- New KK TWY was made in RAMP area.
- As K FILE,  after 10C landing, reverse P then cross RWY10L via CC. other airplane intersection T/O DD to RWY10L.
- GND said "into the aisle" that means to go gate area. GND don't say detail information about gate in. ex )via A19, so have to ask ramp tower.



## DEPARTURE
- ATIS is notified metering CTC inform. Special location is instructed ex )ABEAM M9
- When full length T/O is needed, early request to delivery.
- Usually RWY10L DD or EE intersection departure.  Don't confuse "RWY10L DD" Taxi instruction.
- ORD x departure doesn't have FMS data only chart. So engage only VNAV. And 5, 8NM performance enough no problem.
- RWY28R full length takeoff have to go via TWY Y. refer inset map chart.
- TAXI bump to bump is better method for sequence.
- PUSH BACK BOX1
- As jeppesen chart, RWY 10L/28R takeoff from EE/GG intersection is standard.

- CGO
>CGO spot moved to Northern Cargo area <br>
Ramp Common Blind Broadcasting procedure <br>
Expect long taxi for departure



## STAY
