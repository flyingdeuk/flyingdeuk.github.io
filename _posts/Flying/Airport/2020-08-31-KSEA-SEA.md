## ENROUTE
- If North landing is expected, have to add extra fuel...!!!

## ARRIVAL
- Usually gave us "DES via MANR XX ARR"
- ATC need to watch RWY insight for visual app (it is not traffic info)
- S15 via 99 or S12 (abeam S12 or abeam N contact ramp 122.27)
- GND instruct to contact ramp. but sometimes GND don't, so VHF C 122.27 for backup.
- Usually ATC give us RWY 16L automatically.
- During ILS 16L app, glideslope fluctuation around below 500ft, so maintain dive by vs monitoring.
- In case of north landing, expect heavy traffic on the ground. So have to need extra fuel.

## DEPARTURE
- After takeoff connect CZVR by CPDLC

## STAY
- package delivery free
- SHARPS ROAST HOUSE ribs and chicken strong IPA
