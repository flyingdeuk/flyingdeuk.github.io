## Airport Map

## ENROUTE
- IRNMN x ARR was planning but transitions is not included on the flight plan.
- CARGO can get the DIRBY x ARR as filling, by K file...

## ARRIVAL
- They gave us descend via arrival except 12000'
- After hand off to app, They gave us 'descend via' again after leveling off 12000'
- RWY 24L/R don't have parallel taxiway between both RWY. So be careful.
- GND freq have to change at check point. norh complex to south complex.
- #156 was not needed to contact ramp without instruction. Continue GND freq.
- CARGO area have two spot #1 and #2. be carefull... Left one is the spot #1.
- ATC usually said "descend via 7000ft... 5000ft..." It means follow vertical profile to 7000ft... 5000ft...


## DEPARTURE
- CARGO : ATC asked our spot. KAL CARGO! Main takeoff RWY 25R but they ask prefer RWY
- Somtimes they say "after LAX VOR H/D 000"
- In case of VENT x dep except 3000ft (ATC CLR) after VNAV ALT, airplane accelerate. So need cleanup.
- Only `LADYJ` DEP has a restriction of speed. __(maintain at or below 250KTS unless otherwise directed by ATC.)__ It is like ORD x DEP..
