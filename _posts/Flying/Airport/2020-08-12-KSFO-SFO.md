## ENROUTE
-  If eastern wind expected,It have to expect gate hold procedure. It means delay on the ground several hours. So it needed extra fuel. Because east wind make using RWY 10L/R for departure and RWY 19L for landing.
- It means all departing airplane (domestic, international) using 10L/R. normally 01L/R for domestic light weight airplane and 28L/R for international heavy weight airplane. That is why being gate hold procedure at this airport, I thought.
- So eastern wind forecast, It means extra fuel.  
- In case of Eastern wind, L/D RWY 19L, STLER 3 RNAV ARR is used.

## ARRIVAL
- Usually descend via ARR.
- RWY 28L/R simultaneous app is too close from another traffic. so be careful and keep insight.
- This airport is especially simultaneous takeoff RWY01L/R and simultaneous landing RWY 28L/R. maybe the reason is both RWY angle is cross shape…
- They use inner spot 1 & 3 for inbound, 2 & 4 for outbound




## DEPARTURE
- CPDLC ATC said next freq 121.8 (GND) but have to request push back to ramp tower.
- Usually RWY 28L takeoff

## STAY
- regency lounge is good. 9 floor and smoking area
- Can not buy beer after 12 AM.
- downtown : coffee (4 barrels), blue bottle
