## ENROUTE
- MNL control said "CLR to Lumpur flight plan route"
- SIN also said "CLR to Lumpur via 000 000 000 waypoint" it can refer FMS RTE page.
- to ICN : 10miles before AKOTA contact 119.3

## ARRIVAL
- There is JEP SPD RESTRICTION.
- ATC gave us late descent instructions. be careful
- We should brief STANDARD TAXI RTE. (some STANDARD RTE has 2 way to go to gate. So have to confirm)
- In night time, They call ramp ground instead of apron.
- Sometimes 32R landing.

## DEPARTURE
- They ask DUDIS time. so DUDIS flight plan time + 15min(ground taxi time)
- Also give us DUDIS time by ATC CLR.
- CPDLC log on "WJSC" any time after airborne.
